- **Weights**: weights for FasterRCNN+MobileNetV3, FasterRCNN+ResNet50, RetinaNet+ResNet50, SSD+VGG16, and SSDLite+MobileNetV3 architectures inlcuded in our analysis and timing trials, pretrained on ultrasound phantom data.
- **Videos**: video clips of ultrasound phantom scans used to generate training, validation and testing data for AI model development.
- **Labeled Video Data**: json files containing lesion location annotations.
- **Frames**: individual frames extracted from the video clips.
